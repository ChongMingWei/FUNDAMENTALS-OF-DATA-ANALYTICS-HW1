* Variables


|          | Variable | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|1     | Date         | The date of observation     |
|2     | Location     | The location of the weather station     |
|3     | MinTemp      | The minimum temperature in degrees celsius     |
|4     | MaxTemp      | The maximum temperature in degrees celsius     |
|5     | Rainfall     | The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm     |
|6     | Evaporation  | The so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am     |
|7     | Sunshine     | The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day.   |
|8     | WindGustDir  | The direction of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight     |
|9     | WindGustSpeed| The speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight     |
|10    | WindDir9am   | Direction of the wind at 9am     |
|11    | WindDir3pm   | Direction of the wind at 3pm     |
|12    | WindSpeed9am | Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 9am     |
|13    | WindSpeed3pm | Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 3pm    |
|14    | Humidity9am  | Humidity (percent) at 9am     |
|15    | Humidity3pm  | Humidity (percent) at 3pm     |
|16    | Pressure9am  | Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 9am     |
|17    | Pressure3pm  | Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3pm     |
|18    | Cloud9am     | Fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 9am. This is measured in "oktas", which are a unit of eigths. It records how many eigths of the sky are obscured by cloud. A 0 measure indicates completely clear sky whilst an 8 indicates that it is completely overcast.     |
|19    | Cloud3pm     | Fraction of sky obscured by cloud (in "oktas": eighths) at 3pm. See Cload9am for a description of the values     |
|20    | Temp9am      | Temperature (degrees C) at 9am    |
|21    | Temp3pm      | Temperature (degrees C) at 3pm    |
|22    | RainToday    | Boolean: 1 if precipitation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0     |
|23    | RISK_MM      | The amount of next day rain in mm. Used to create response variable RainTomorrow. A kind of measure of the "risk".     |
|24     | RainTomorrow| The target variable. Did it rain tomorrow?     |
